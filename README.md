# Power-Outages in Mali

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of power outages in Mali. I have collected a dataset of communiqu√©s issued by the Mali power company, which detail various power outages. Utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, I converted these documents, originally in image format, into machine-readable text.

The core of this project lies in applying AI techniques to extract and analyze pertinent information from these texts. I focused on key metrics such as:

The number of power outages.<br>
The duration of each outage.<br>
The cumulative duration of all outages.<br>

This data was meticulously processed and organized into a JSON format, which was then integrated into a spreadsheet for further analysis and visualization.
